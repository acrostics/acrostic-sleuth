Idols away, and treaſure-ſearching fire
Shall burn the ground and rage with fatal ire,
Through ſeas and ſkies, and break hells black fate,
So shall free light ſalute the bleſſed ſtate
Of Saints; the guilty in laſting flames shall burn,
No act ſo bad but thence to light shall turn;
Nor breaſt ſo cloſed but God shall open wide,
Each, where shall crys be heard, and noiſe beſide,
Of gnaſhing teeth. The ſun shall from the ſky
Fly ſouth, and ſtars no more move orderly;
Great heaven shall be diſſolv'd the moon depriv'd
Of all her light, places at height arriv'd
Depreſt, and valleys mounted to their ſeat;
There shall be nought to mortals high or great;
Hills shall be levell'd with the plains, the ſea
Endure no burthen, and the earth as they
Shall periſh, cleft with lightning, every ſpring⟩,
And rivers burn, the fatal trump ſhall bring;
Unto the world from heaven a diſ blaſt,
Including plague to come for ill deeds paſt:
Old Chaos through the ſcatter'd mass appears,
Unto this bar all kings come priſoners,
Raptur'd with joy, or overwhelm'd with fears.
"A ſecond Prophecy of" Paul Greener's, "preſaging the reſtoring of divers princes of the empire, &amp;c. and the downfall of the papal authority."
THE Lord (ſaith he) doth raiſe up an elector which ſhall throw down and root out the "Roman" antichriſt in his dominions, with her members and abetters in this valiant precipitated tumult raging like a ſea in a tempeſt: many princes ſhall be reſtored to their rights, former eſtates and libberties: and a noble ſtout "Bohemian" lord doth recover his juriſdiction by the meeting of armies and their diſſipation, and the heirs of ſuch as are expelled ſhall contend and labour; that by the bounty of the emperor of "Germany" they may be ſet again in the place of their ancestors.
"A Prophecy relating to the preſent times, and found written above a hundred years ſince in the cathedral church of Edinburgh, ſaid to be predicted by one" Mother Greg.
IF the orange ſhall engrafted be,
Tales in the royal oak that ſtately tree,
