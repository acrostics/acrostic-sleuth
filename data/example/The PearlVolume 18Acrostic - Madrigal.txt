The Pearl/Volume 18/Acrostic - Madrigal


C ome love and dwell with me 
U nder the greenwood tree, 
N o one can happy be, 
T han I shall be if bless'd with thee!
P laced near your mossy grot, 
R ises a rustic cot. 
I would bear thee to that spot, 
C ool when the sun is hot; 
K ind fair one, linger not!
F lowers bloom their brightest there! 
U nknown fragrance fills the air! 
C ome, sweet Chloe, grant the prayer, 
K neeling I make to thee!
