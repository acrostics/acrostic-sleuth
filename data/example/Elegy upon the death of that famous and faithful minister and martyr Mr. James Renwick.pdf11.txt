And rest lamenting, while i ‘th‘ vale of tears,
Our growing grief, and fresh recurring fears.

An "Anagram" on

MASTER JAMES RENWICK.

"I am Christ's meek Servant."

An Acrostic on the same.

|-
| Meekness and || Magnanimity most rare,
| Advanc'd thy || Actions with advantage fair,
| Submissive || Self denial, suffering slights,
| Twisted with || True zeal for Emmanuel's rights,
| Extoll'd thee || Early in esteem and fame,
| Renowned || Renwick, evermore the same.
| Jehovah || Jireh was thy constant joy.
| Along thy || Always arduous employ :
| Magnified || Martyr! men thee much admire ;
| Enemies || Envy, and enraged ire,
| Shaming them || Selves, thy sufferings to bespatter.
| Reproaches|| Restless with renown did scatter,
| Eminent || Enterprises in all dangers,
| Noble thy || Name have notify'd to strangers,
| Vexations || Various suffered valiantly.
| Imbalm’d thy || Innocence to memory.
| Comfort from || Christ did stop all thy complaints,
| Kill‘d thour’t for || Keeping his commandments.

FINIS.
