The Pearl/Volume 18/Acrostic - The Martyr


F irm as a rock the noble martyr stood, 
U nbending as a rod of tempered steel; 
C almly he sees the touch ignite the wood, 
K nowing the agony he soon must feel.
M ighty the influence which makes the body 
Y ield prompt obedience to the power of will!
C onscious of being right, this is the motto, 
U pon his banner writ in words of light. 
N o other motive can supply the power, 
T o cheer the martyr in his dying hour!
D ying because he would maintain the right, 
E ver should rule in place of boastful might! 
A nd so the martyr's name shall never die, 
R ound the whole world the stirring tale shall fly.
P eoples unborn his noble name shall learn, 
A nd his example make their bosoms burn; 
P atriots shall hail him as a brother true, 
A nd write his history for all to view!
