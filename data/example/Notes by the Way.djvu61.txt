Ebsworth had previously shown his esteem for Joseph Knight by dedicating to him in 1889, in his 'Roxburghe Ballads,' "the first group of Trades and Sports." He did so in the following terms: 

TO JOSEPH KNIGHT.

" A gentle Knight was pricking on the plaine."
"A gentleKnight."
Spenser's 'Faerie Queene,' Canto I. 
Dedicated, 
In Affectionate Esteem,
To One whose Knowledge of our English Drama is that of a
Scholar, unrivalled also in recognizing the excellence
of Acting with competent judgment of the trained
Critic ; generously according praise where
praise may be deserved ; never unkind
or unjust, when constrained
to condemn.
 Through rain and sleet, where wild winds rage and moil
 On many a cheerless road, men journeying fret, 
 Jaded, till from thy hand warm clasp they get,
 Old Friend ! whom Time and Chance lack power to spoil. 
 Soon Shuffling-off their weary mortal-coil, 
 Even as they flung hence garments soiled or wet, 
 Pleased to have paid in full stern Nature's debt, 
 Haste they to climes where none need grieve or toil. 
 Keep on thy way ! secure of love and praise, 
 Never repining, while our world may wag; 
 Is there one grudges thee thy blithsome days? 
 Good-Fellowship can nowhere pine or flag 
 Holding thy genial presence, that out-weighs 
 Ten-fold each prize in Fortune's Lucky-Bag.

Capt. Helbert wrote to me on the 5th of July : "I cannot write about our dear friend. I seem dazed when I put pen to 
paper; the shock of his loss still hangs upon me. His courtesy and tender-heartedness were remarkable in these days of rush. How gentle and loving were his words and works!" Capt. Helbert survived his old friend only a few months. 
Ebsworth wrote to me: "He who has left us was dearly loved by all who had the privilege of knowing him, and can man cease to be hallowed in memory as he himself would have wished, modest and self-retentive from all conceit and vainglory though he was. We were both of us privileged to know and love this noble man long and uncloudedly."
