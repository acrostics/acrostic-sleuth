"A Predicton of Dooms-day, upon theſe words," viz. Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, the Saviour.

IN ſign of Dooms-day the whole world shall ſweat,
Ever to reign a King in heaverly ſeat;
Shall come to judge all flesh, the faithful and
Unfaithful too before his God shall ſtand.
Corporeal he shall ſit, and thence extend,
His doom in ſouls: the earth shall quite lie waſte,
Ruin'd, o'ergrown with thorns, and men shall caſt
Idols away, and treaſure-ſearching fire

Great heaven shall be diſſolv'd, the moon depriv'd
Of all her light, places at heigt arriv'd
Depreſt, and valleys mounted to their ſeat;
There shall be nought to mortals high or great;
Hills ſhall be levell’d with the plains, the ſea
Endure no burthen, and the earth as they
Shall periſh, cleft with lightning, every ſpring,
And rivers burn, the fatal trump ſhall bring;
Unto the world from heaven a dismal blaſt,
Including plagues to come for ill deeds paſt:
Old Chaos through the ſcatter'd maſs appears,
Unto this bar all kings come priſoners,
Raptur'd with joy, or overwhelm'd with fears.



"A ſecond Prophecy of" Paul Greener's, "preſaging the reſtoring of divers Princes of the Empire, &amp;c. and the downfal of the Papal Authority."
THE Lord (ſaith he) doth raiſe up an elector which ſhall throw down, and root of the Roman Antichriſt in his dominions, with her members and abettors, in this valiant precipitated tumult, raging like a ſea in a tempeſt: Many princes ſhall be reſtored to their rights, former eſtates and liberties: And a noble ſtout Bohemian Lord doth recover his juriſdiction by the meeting of ar-
