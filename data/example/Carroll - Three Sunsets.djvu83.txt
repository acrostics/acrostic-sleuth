Puck has ventured back agen:
Ridicule no more affrights him:
In the very haunts of men
Newer sport delights him.
Capering lightly to and fro,
Ever frolicking and funningâ€”
"Crack!" the mimic pistols go!
Hark! The noise is stunning!
All too soon will Childhood gay
Realise Life's sober sadness.
Let's be merry while we may,
Innocent and happy Fay!
Elves were made for gladness!
"Nov". 25, 1891.
