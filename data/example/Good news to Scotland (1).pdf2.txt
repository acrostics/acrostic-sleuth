MOST noble Cameron of renown,
A fame of thee shall ne'er go down;
S ince Truth with zeal thou didst pursue,
T o "Zion"'s King loyal and true :
E v'n when the dragon spu’d his flood,
R esist thou didst unto the blood;
⁠Ran swiftly in thy Christian race
I n faith and patience to that place,
C hrist did prepare for such as thee,
H e knew would not his standard flee,
A pattern of valour and zeal,
R ather to suffer than to fail ;
D idst shew thyself with might and main,
C ounting dross what others thought gain:
A faithful witness 'gainst all those
M en, of all sorts did truth oppose:
E v'n thou with "Moses" did esteem
R eproaches for the God of heaven ;
O n him alone thou didst rely,
N ot sparing for his cause to die!
William Wilson.
