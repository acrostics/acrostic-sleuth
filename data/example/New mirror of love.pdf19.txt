If lore did expectations raise,
⁠To kneel in Hymen’s shrine;
I must consider then, your lays,
⁠A pretty Valentine.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

I s there a heart that does not feel
L ove’s gentle impulse lurking steal,
O n downy pinions, to his breast?
V ainly I hail the pleasing guest,
E xcept, in off’ring of my heart,
Y our’s take in mine an equal part.
O tell me this, and love shall soon
U nite our two fond hearts in one.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

H ow sweet are the early spring flow’rs.
E nliv’ning the winter-clad plain!
N ot a bird on the tree but carols to see
R eviving those beauties and bow’rs,
You’ve sigh’d for with me, but in vain.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

S hall I still in secret pine,
U nless you’ll be my Valentine?
