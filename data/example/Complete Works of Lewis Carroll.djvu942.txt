ACROSTICS, INSCRIPTIONS, 
AND OTHER VERSES
ACROSTIC
Little maidens, when you look 
On this little story-book, 
Reading with attentive eye 
Its enticing history, 
Never think that hours of play 
Are your only HOLIDAY, 
And that in a HOUSE of joy 
Lessons serve but to annoy : 
If in any HOUSE you find 
Children of a gentle mind. 
Each the others pleasing ever — 
Each the others vexing never — 
Daily work and pastime daily 
In their order taking gaily — 
Then be very sure that they 
Have a life of HOLIDAY. 
Christmas 1861.
