THE GREAT DIVIDE.
"AN ACROSTIC."
"(See Note 3.)"


"T"wo little rain drops side by side 
"H"ere at the top of the Great Divide, 
"E"ver while falling their love grows warm, 
"G"rows as they drift in the arms of the storm. 
"R"estless they float where the wild winds fly, 
"E"arthward they gaze from the cloudland high, 
"A"imless no longer they rush below, 
"T"winkling their eyes in the sunset glow, 
"D"own to the flowers, the rivers and trees, 
"I"nto the paths of the summer breeze, 
"V"owing to wander together for aye, 
"I"nto the fatal divide they stray; 
"D"ivided for ever they float along, 
"E"ach sings to the other a parting song.
