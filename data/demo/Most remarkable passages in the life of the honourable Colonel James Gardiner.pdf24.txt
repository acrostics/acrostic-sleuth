were dreadfully legible on the countenance of many
who survived it. They entered Colonel Gardiner's
house before he was carried off from the field, and,
notwithstanding the strict orders which the unhappy
Duke of Perth (whose conduct is said to have been
very humane in many instances) gave to the contrary,
every thing of value was plundered, to the very
curtains of the beds, and hangings of the rooms.-
His papers were all thrown into the wildest disorder,
and his house made an hospital for the receptior of
those who were wounded in the action.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



Joy cease to flow, while I relate,
A mournful tale of GARDINER's fate,
Most shocking to the human mind:
Envy and cruelty combin'd,
Sure did possess that rebel blind,
'Gainst reason could a butcher be,
And murder one who could not flee.
Rare Champion in his country's cause!
Dar'd to maintain BRITANNIA's Laws,
In face of danger boldly stood,
Nor flinch'd tho' he had loft much blood.
Even envy can't his valour stain,
Renown'd must GARDINER's same remain.
