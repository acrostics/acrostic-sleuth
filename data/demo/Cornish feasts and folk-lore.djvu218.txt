well as many of their sayings and rh}'mes) much too broad for 
the taste of this generation, and would only be tolerated in the 
days when "a spade was called a spade." There are two exceptions 
that I know worth transcribing ; one has already appeared with 
its answer, through the Rev. S. Rundle, in Transactions Penzance 
Natural History and Antiquarian Society, 1 88^-86. , 
" Riddle me ! riddle me right ! 
Guess where I was to last Saturday night. 
Up in the old ivy tree, 
Two old foxes under me, 
Digging a grave to bury me. 
First I heard the wind blow, 
Then I heard the cock crow. 
Then I saw the chin-champ chawing up his bridle. 
Then I saw the work-man working hisself idle." 
Answer. — A young woman made an appointment to meet her 
sweetheart ; arriving first at the place, she climbed into an ivy- 
covered tree to await his coming. He came in company with 
another man, and not seeing her "the two old foxes" began to 
dig a grave, in which from her hiding-place she heard that after 
murdering they intended putting her. The " chin-champ " was the 
horse on which they rode away, when they failed to discover her. 
" Working hisself idle," is working in vain. 
" As I went over London bridge 
Upon a cloudy day, 
I met a fellow, clothed in yellow, 
I took him up and sucked his blood. 
And threw his skin away." 
What was he? Answer. — An orange. 
With a nonsensical acrostic on the word Finis, well known in 
the beginning of this century, I must end this (I fear) long, ram- 
bling work. 
"F — for Francis, 
I — for Jancis, 
N — for Nich'las Bony ; 
I — for John the water-man, 
S — for Sally Stony."
