T "he sickness hot," "a master quit, for fear,"
H"is house in town, and left one servant there;"

L"eaving their narrow practice, were become"
C"ozeners at large; and only wanting some"
H"ouse to set up; with him they here contract,"

I"n casting figures, idling fortunes, news,"
S"elling of flies," "flat bawdry with the stone,"
T"ill it, and they, and all in fume are gone."
