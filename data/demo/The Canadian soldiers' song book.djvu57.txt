For auld lang syne, my dear
For auld lang syne;
We'll tak' a cup o' kindness yet,
For auld lang syne.


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
⁠We have sung your song of Tipperary,
⁠As we sat in the campfire's glow.
⁠We have marched along to that well-known song
⁠"Are we down-hearted—No."
And now we're singing "Keep the Home Fires burning."
⁠But there's one song we miss o'er the foam,
⁠That's the song the kettle is singing on the hob
⁠In a dear little place called home.


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
⁠There's a train that calls me homeward, night and day;
⁠In my dreams the loved ones beckon, far away.
⁠Through the shadows and the sunshine,
⁠Someday I shall roam,
Down that long, long trail a-winding,
⁠The trail that leads back to home.


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
I love you Canada,
For you mean so much to me,
I love your hills and valleys,
And your stately Maple trees.
I love all your dear people,
Though far away I roam,
When I then speak of Canada,
I long for Home Sweet Home.


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"M" is for the million things she gave me,
"O" means only that she's growing old,
"T" is for the tears she shed to save me,
"H" is for her heart of purest gold;
"E" is for her eyes, with love-light shining,
"R" means right, and right she'll always be,
Put them all together, they spell "Mother,"
A word that means the world to me.
