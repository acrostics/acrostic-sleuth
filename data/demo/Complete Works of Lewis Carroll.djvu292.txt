A BOAT, beneath a sunny sky 
Lingering onward dreamily 
In an evening of July — 
Children three that nestle near, 
Eager eye and willing ear, 
Pleased a simple tale to hear — 
Long has paled that sunny sky: 
Echoes fade and memories die: 
Autumn frosts have slain July. 
Still she haunts me, phantomwise. 
Alice moving under skies 
Never seen by waking eyes. 
Children yet, the tale to hear, 
Eager eye and willing ear. 
Lovingly shall nestle near. 
In a Wonderland they lie. 
Dreaming as the days go by. 
Dreaming as the summers die : 
Ever drifting down the stream — 
Lingering in the golden gleam — 
Life, what is it but a dream? 
Editor's note: The initial letters of this poem 
when read downward give the full name of 
the original Alice — Alice Pleasance Liddell.
