Girt with a boyish garb for boyish task, 
⁠Eager she wields her spade: yet loves as well 
Rest on a friendly knee, intent to ask 
⁠The tale one loves to tell. 
Rude scoffer of the seething outer strife, 
⁠Unmeet to read her pure and simple spright. 
Deem, if thou wilt, such hours a waste of life, 
⁠Empty of all delight! 
Chat on, sweet Maid, and rescue from annoy 
⁠Hearts that by wiser talk are unbeguiled 
Ah, happy he who owns that tenderest joy,
⁠The heart-love of a child!
Away, fond thoughts, and vex my soul no more! 
⁠Work claims my wakeful nights, my busy days 
Albeit bright memories of that sunlit shore 
⁠Yet haunt my dreaming gaze
