AN ACROSTIC ON HIS NAME.
Most sweet and savoury is thy fame,
And more renowned is thy name,
Surely than any can record,
Thou highly favoured of the Lord.
Exalted thou on earth didst live;
Rich grace to thee the Lord did give.
During the time thou dwelt below,
On in a course to heaven didst go.
Not casten down with doubts and fears,
Assur'd of heaven near thirty years.
Labour thou didst in Christ’s vineyard;
Diligent wast, no time thou spar'd.
Christ’s standard thou didst bear alone,
After others from it were gone.
Right zeal for truth was found in thee,
Great sinners censurd’st faithfully.
In holding truth didst constant prove,
Laidst down thy life out of true love.
