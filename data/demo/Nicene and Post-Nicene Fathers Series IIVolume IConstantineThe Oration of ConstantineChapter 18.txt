Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers: Series II/Volume I/Constantine/The Oration of Constantine/Chapter 18

Chapter XVIII.—"Of the Erythræan Sibyl, who pointed in a Prophetic Acrostic at our Lord and his Passion. The Acrostic is “Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour, Cross.”"
My desire, however, is to derive even from foreign sources a
testimony to the Divine nature of Christ. For on such testimony it is
evident that even those who blaspheme his name must acknowledge that he
is God, and the Son of God if indeed they will accredit the words of
those whose sentiments coincided with their own.
“Of their own selves.” The Erythræan Sibyl, then, who
herself assures us that she lived in the sixth generation after the
flood, was a priestess of Apollo, who wore the sacred fillet in
imitation of the God she served, who guarded also the tripod
encompassed with the serpent’s folds, and returned prophetic
answers to those who approached her shrine; having been devoted by the
folly of her parents to this service, a service productive of nothing
good or noble, but only of indecent fury, such as we find recorded in
the case of Daphne.
[Daughter of Tiresias, and priestess at Delphi. She was called
Sibyl, on account of the wildness of her looks and expressions when she
delivered oracles (Lempriere in voc.).—"Bag."] On one
occasion, however, having rushed into the sanctuary of her vain
superstition, she became really filled with inspiration from above, and
declared in prophetic verses the future purposes of God; plainly
indicating the advent of Jesus by the initial letters of these verses,
forming an acrostic in these words: Jesus Christ, Son
of God, Saviour, Cross. The verses themselves are as
follows:
Judgment! Earth’s oozing
pores
[ ῾Ιδρώσει
γὰρ χθὼν,
κ.τ.λ.—"Bag."] shall mark the day;
Earth’s heavenly king his
glories shall display:
Sovereign of all, exalted on his
throne,
Unnumbered multitudes their God
shall own;
Shall see their Judge, with mingled
joy and fear,
Crowned with his saints, in human
form appear.
How vain, while desolate
earth’s glories lie,
Riches, and pomp, and man’s
idolatry!
In that dread hour, when
Nature’s fiery doom
Startles the slumb’ring
tenants of the tomb,
Trembling all flesh shall stand;
each secret wile,
Sins long forgotten, thoughts of
guilt and guile,
Open beneath God’s searching
light shall lie:
No refuge then, but hopeless
agony.
O’er heaven’s expanse
shall gathering shades of night
From earth, sun, stars, and moon,
withdraw their light;
God’s arm shall crush each
mountain’s towering pride;
On ocean’s plain no more shall
navies ride.
Dried at the source, no
river’s rushing sound
Shall soothe, no fountain slake the
parched ground.
Around, afar, shall roll the
trumpet’s blast,
Voice of wrath long delayed,
revealed at last.
In speechless awe, while
earth’s foundations groan,
On judgment’s seat
earth’s kings their God shall own.
Uplifted then, in majesty divine,
Radiant with light, behold
Salvation’s Sign!
Cross of that Lord, who, once for
sinners given,
Reviled by man, now owned by earth
and heaven,
O’er every land extends his
iron sway.
Such is the name these mystic lines
display;
Saviour, eternal king, who
bears our sins away.
[It can scarcely be necessary to observe that the acrostic, the
general sense of which has been aimed at in the above translation, must
be regarded as the pious fiction of some writer, whose object was to
recommend the truth of Christianity to heathens by an appeal to the
authority of an (alleged) ancient heathen prophecy.—"Bag."]
The quotation is found in the edition of Alexandre, Bk. VIII. ch.
219–250. (Cf. translation in Augustin, "De civ. Dei.") The
translation of "Bag.," giving the “general sense” and
reproducing the acrostic, stands unchanged. The translation of 1709,
much more vigorous and suggestive of the “Dies Iræ,”
is as follows:
“When the Great Day of
Judgment shall appear,
The melting Earth shall then
dissolve with fear;
A King Immortal shall from
Heav’n descend,
At whose Tribunal the whole
world attend.
Both Just and Wicked shall,
when Time grows old,
Their mighty God in flesh
array’d behold;
Armies of Saints on His Right
hand shall come,
Whilst Humane Souls expect
their final doom.
Th’ Universe shall be a
dry, Barren Strand,
And Thorns shall flourish on
the scorched land;
Men shall with indignation cast
away
Their Wealth and Idols in that
dreadful day.
The parching Earth, and Heaven
in flames shall fry,
And searching fire drain the
Ocean dry:
All flesh which in the Grave
imprison’d lay,
Shake off their Fetters, and
return to Day.
Fire ’twixt Good and Bad
shall diff’rence make,
And filthy Dross from purer
Metal take.
Man’s secret Deeds shall
all be open lay’d,
And th’ obscure Mazes of
their Hearts displayed;
Gnashing their Teeth, they
shall their Fate bewail:
The stars harmonious dance, and
th’ Sun shall fail.
The Orbs roll’d up,
shrink into darkest night,
The Labouring Moon shall lose
her borrowed light.
Mountains with Plains on the
same Level lye;
Vallies shall gape no more, nor
Hills be high.
On the proud Billows Ships
shall ride no more:
And Lightning the Earth’s
Face shall shrivel sore.
The crackling Rivers with
fierce Fire shall burn,
Which shall their streams to
solid Crystal turn.
The Heav’nly Trump shall
blow a doleful sound,
And th’ world’s
destruction, and its sin resound.
The yawning Earth Hell’s
vast Abyss shall shew;
All Kings before God’s
just Tribunal go.
Then Liquid Sulphur from the
Sky shall stream,
God shall pour down Rivers of
vengeful flame;
All men shall then the Glorious
Cross descry,
That wished-for sign unto a
faithful eye:
The Life of pious Souls, their
chief delight;
To Sinners an Offence, a dismal
sight!
Enlightening the called with
its beams,
When cleansed from sin in twice
six limpid streams.
His Empire shall be boundless,
and that God
Shall Rule the Wicked with an
Iron Rod;
This God, Immortal King,
describ’d in Verse,
Our Saviour, dying,
shall man’s doom Reverse.”
It is evident that the virgin
uttered these verses under the influence of Divine inspiration. And I
cannot but esteem her blessed, whom the Saviour thus selected to unfold
his gracious purpose towards us.
