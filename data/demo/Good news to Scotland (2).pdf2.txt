Upon the name of that Godly, faithful and zealous Minister and Martyr of JESUS CHRIST,
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Done by a true lover of his Memory, and Owner of the honourable Cause which he sealed with his Blood.

MOST noble Cameron of renown,
A fame of thee shall ne'er go down;
S ince Truth with zeal thou didst pursue,
T o Zion's King loyal and true 
E v'n when the dragon spu'd his flood,
R esist thou didst unto the blood;
R an swiftly in thy Christian race,
I n faith and patience to that place,
C hrist did prepare for such as thee,
H e knew would not his standard flee,
A pattern of valour and zeal,
R ather to suffer than to fail;
D idst shew thyself with might and main,
C ounting dross what others thought gain:
A faithful witness 'gainst all those
M en of all sorts did truth oppose:
E v'n thou with Moses did esteem
R eproaches for the God of heaven;
O n him alone thou didst rely,
N ot sparing for his cause to die!
William Wilson.
